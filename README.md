# SIMOA_FINAL
This is the github I will use once my MI is done. That way it will be easier for me to keep track of the analysis I did with the imputed data. It will also allow me to restart my code and make it more efficient and ensure I am getting everything I need without having too many lines that are repeating the same steps.
